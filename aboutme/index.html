    <h2>Jere</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone nice to meet you all. I'm Jeremias Moracca and I live in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
       I'm 23 years old.
       Earlier this year I finished my studies in meteorological observation and I've been working as an observer for almost 4 months now.
       For almost 2 years I have been running a small real-estate photography business.
       I served a mission in the Trinidad & Tobago, Port of Spain mission (TPOSM for short) in 2017-2019. It was a big part in me developing a testimony of the Gospel and Jesus CHrist for myself.
       I'm also currently an Institute teacher which is something I deeply enjoy doing.</p>
       
    <p>My hobbies include: Photography, Going to the gym, Playing board games, Listening to music, Kayaking and Hiking to name a few</p>
